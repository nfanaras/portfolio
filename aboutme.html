      <h2 class="studieshead" id="main">Studies</h2>
      <p id ="studiesp">Before college, I spent my whole life in Riverview, Michigan (a super small town about 20 minutes south of Detroit).
          In high school, I danced, golfed, and was super devoted to my academics. After senior year, I attended Michigan State University (MSU)
          for a semester, then decided to transfer to University of Michigan - Dearborn (UMD) for Computer Science. I heard from a friend about an awesome program at the School of Information
          at UofM (UMSI) - Ann Arbor and spent most of my time at UMD working towards my application to UMSI. Now, I'm a junior year transfer student here at UMSI
          studying UX Design and I couldn't be happier with the program.</p>

      <h2 class="greekhead">Background & Heritage</h2>
      <p id="greekp">Something extremely important to me is my ethnicity. I come from a big Greek family who supports me in every aspect of my life and feeds me, a lot. I grew up going to St. George's
      Greek Orthodox Church with my grandparents. At UofM, I joined the Hellenic Student Assocation (HSA) where I get to express myself and my culture with others who
      share same traditions and beliefs. I still have family that lives in Greece, one of my favorite things to do is visit them every summer to catch up on some family time, but also as a
      getaway from Michigan.</p>

      <h2 class="musichead">Music</h2>
      <p id="musicp">Music is my favorite de-stresser. I'm really into alternative, but also open to other genres. My favorite artists at the moment would have to be Turnover, Elliott Smith, and Beach House. Lorde and Fleetwood Mac - all time favorites.</p>
