      <h2 class="studieshead" id="main">Studies</h2>
      <p id ="studiesp">Before college, I spent my whole life in Riverview, Michigan (a super small town about 20 minutes south of Detroit).
          In high school, I danced, golfed, and was super devoted to my academics. After senior year, I attended Michigan State University (MSU)
          for a semester, then decided to transfer to University of Michigan - Dearborn (UMD) for Computer Science. I heard from a friend about an awesome program at the School of Information
          at UofM (UMSI) - Ann Arbor and spent most of my time at UMD working towards my application to UMSI. Now, I'm a junior year transfer student here at UMSI
          studying UX Design and I couldn't be happier with the program.</p>

      <h2 class="greekhead">Background & Heritage</h2>
      <p id="greekp">Something extremely important to me is my ethnicity. I come from a big Greek family who supports me in every aspect of my life and feeds me, a lot. I grew up going to St. George's
      Greek Orthodox Church with my grandparents. At UofM, I joined the Hellenic Student Assocation (HSA) where I get to express myself and my culture with others who
      share same traditions and beleifs. I still have family that lives in Greece, one of my favorite things to do is visit them every summer to catch up on some family time, but also as a
      getaway from Michigan.</p>

      <h2 class="musichead">Music</h2>
      <p id="musicp">Music has got to be the one easiest thing that gets me through a hard day. It de-stresses me, keeps me focused when I work, and gets me excited for a night out.
        I'm really into alternative music, but open to other genres. My favorite artists at the moment would have to be Turnover, Joji, Tame Impala, Elliott Smith, and Beach House. Lorde and Fleetwood Mac however - all time favorites.</p>
