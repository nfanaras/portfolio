At UMD, I completed multiple complex projects in my computer science courses. They
included concepts such as user interface input and output, file data, loops, arrays, data classes,
pointers, recursion, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Priority Queue
In this project I implemented a simulation of a priority queue in Microsoft Visual Studio
C++ based off of four randomly generated types of jobs, one with a high priority that skips
to the front of the queue. It was an individual project and I had about a month to complete it,
so I had to take on all the roles of the project on my own in a limited amount of time.

Class Creation
This project required the creation of a "string" class. I designed and implemented my own
version of the "string" class using various methods to manipulate objects and output
results based on user input.
