My first internship was for the City of Southgate's Downtown Development Authority (DDA).
The DDA's purpose is to create an environment that promotes commerce for the District of
Downtown Southgate. My job was to assist the DDA Director with a main responsibility of
managing the city's Facebook and Instagram accounts. I also helped run Market in the Park,
a weekly summer event with shopping from 40+ vendors, live music, food, and more. I created
templates for advertising, in house needs, and meetings and also visited businesses searching
for sponsorships for events like Market in the Park.

During my sophomore year of college, I started working at a Starbucks on UofM's campus. This job
really taught me time management and customer service skills by being able to craft about 80 drinks
per hour while keeping good contact with customers. At Starbucks, I got to connect with some really
great people, whether it be coworkers or customers. It's a place where everyone felt comfortable in
expressing themselves and also enjoyed some tasty coffee.
